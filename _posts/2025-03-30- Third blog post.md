This week I set myself a bunch of little small goals. I find for me that is how I best tackle big goals is to get the small stuff out of the way first because that is usually what I get tripped up on. My small goals that I set for myself was to first download all the spectroscopic data for my object from Vizier. My second goal was for me to read through the documentation of this program called starfish that is supposed to be a really easy method of estimating physical parameters from spectral data. I want to read through this documentation and begin writing out a script for estimating metallicities. I also need to read that paper danny sent me about converting magnitudes.
